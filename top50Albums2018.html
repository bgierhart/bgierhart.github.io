      <h1>My Top 50 Albums of 2018</h1>
    <p>I finally did it. I listened to 150+ albums in 2018 – thank God for Spotify – and the list I made is below. Please use the links to navigate to different sections of the list. At the bottom, you'll find a playlist consisting of my favorite song from each album. Enjoy! </p>

	<div class="albums"><img class="swimming" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MacMiller_Swimming.jpg" alt="The album cover to Swimming by Mac Miller.">
		<h2 class="albums">Swimming by Mac Miller</h2>
		<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rap Album</h3>
		<p>It's an utter shame when someone young passes away. To be honest, I hadn't heard of Mac Miller before his passing. This album is largely hit or miss, but songs like "Self Care" seemed to indicate there were great things to come. R.I.P.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MGMT_LittleDarkAge.jpg" alt="The album cover to Little Dark Age by MGMT.">
			<h2 class="albums">Little Dark Age by MGMT</h2>
			<p>This was simply a pleasant listen. No reinventing the wheel here, but "Me and Michael" proves that not everything has to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Maluma_FAME.jpg" alt="The album cover to F.A.M.E. by Maluma.">
			<h2 class="albums">F.A.M.E. by Maluma</h2>
			<p>Maluma is my Latin pop star guilty pleasure. He's got a sultry voice and some great videos. This album wasn't quite the statement of his arrival in mainstream pop music that I hoped it would be, but it was welcome nonetheless. Check out "El Préstamo" and "Marinero."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Metric_ArtofDoubt.jpg" alt="The album cover to Art of Doubt by Metric.">
			<h2 class="albums">Art of Doubt by Metric</h2>
			<p>Raise your hand if you discovered Metric from Academy Award Winner Brie Larson's *cough* superior cover of one of their songs in Scott Pilgrim? Well, I did anyway. I'm glad I became a fan because their catalogue is a lot of fun. "Now or Never Now" is a huge song and isn't afraid to admit it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Chvrches_LoveIsDead.jpg" alt="The album cover to Love Is Dead by Chvrches.">
			<h2 class="albums">Love Is Dead by Chvrches</h2>
			<p>Out of the 70 albums on this list, this was perhaps my biggest disappointment. Chvrches is fun and brash, unapologetic in its youthful electronic dance energy, and this one seemed to take itself a little too seriously. Check out "Miracle" though. It's classic Chvrches, albeit a little more poppy.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ShawnMendes_ShawnMendes.jpg" alt="The album cover to Shawn Mendes by Shawn Mendes.">
			<h2 class="albums">Shawn Mendes by Shawn Mendes</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Pop Vocal Album</h3>
			<p>If his previous work has solidified his placement as a teenage heartthrob, this album is the beginning of his transition into something a little more serious. He's still got a ways to go, but there's a real artist somewhere in the person who helped create "Lost In Japan."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ArcticMonkey_Tranquility.jpg" alt="The album cover to Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino by Arctic Monkeys.">
			<h2 class="albums">Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino by Arctic Monkeys</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Alternative Music Album</h3>
			<p>I love me some Arctic Monkeys, but this one was kind of a bummer. Look, it's a concept album about a hotel on the moon. No one wanted to like it more than I did. Unfortunately, this album ended up being little more than a David Bowie impression. I mean, a decent one, but an impression nonetheless. "Four Out Of Five" is where that tactic seemed to work for them best.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/BebeRexha_Expectations.jpg" alt="The album cover to Expectations by Bebe Rexha.">
			<h2 class="albums">Expectations by Bebe Rexha</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best New Artist</h3>
			<p>Bebe Rexha seemed to come out of nowhere for me. I'm not completely sold that she's more than a flash in the pan, but man, "I'm A Mess" is catchy and true as hell.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/KylieMinogue_Golden.jpg" alt="The album cover to Golden by Kylie Minogue.">
			<h2 class="albums">Golden by Kylie Minogue</h2>
			<p>This is your first of probably several reminders that this blog is written by a gay man. This album is a hot mess, and I love it anyway. I mean, why is an Australian making a country music album with a song that prominently features a Cuban reggaeton band? Why not? Step it up, Keith Urban.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/RitaOra_Phoenix.jpg" alt="The album cover to Phoenix by Rita Ora.">
			<h2 class="albums">Phoenix by Rita Ora</h2>
			<p>When will Rita Ora get the mainstream American audience that she deserves? Who knows, but here's another album full of bangers for you to ignore. One of my friends called her "Value Brand Rihanna," and... I admit that's hilarious. It also hurt though.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Florence_HighAsHope.jpg" alt="The album cover to High As Hope by Florence + the Machine.">
			<h2 class="albums">High As Hope by Florence + the Machine</h2>
			<p>I guess I'll just have to accept that I'll forever be chasing the high of Florence's first two albums for the rest of my life. Nothing here really comes close except for "Hunger," which shows that Welch's penchant for the dramatic and killer voice are very much intact.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/FallOutBoy_Mania.jpg" alt="The album cover to MANIA by Fall Out Boy.">
			<h2 class="albums">MANIA by Fall Out Boy</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rock Album</h3>
			<p>Perhaps my guiltiest of guiltiest pleasures, I happen to think the world is better for having Fall Out Boy in it. Their album "God Save Rock and Roll" is legitimately good by any standard, and while "MANIA" doesn't quite reach the same cheekiness, it has its moments.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Panic_PrayForTheWicked.jpg" alt="The album cover to Pray For The Wicked by Panic! at the Disco.">
			<h2 class="albums">Pray For The Wicked by Panic! At The Disco</h2>
			<p>I'm going to admit that the sole reason this album is here is for the stellar song "High Hopes." I loved Panic! at the Disco as much as anyone else in high school and listented to their albums with dedication. "High Hopes" so perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to want to make something of yourself that it never fails to pump me up. Also, it's full of little musical easter eggs from the different sounds the band has attempted over the years. It's fun, well constructed, and if you don't like it, I don't like you.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MeanGirlsOCR.jpg" alt="The cover to the Mean Girls Original Cast Recording.">
			<h2 class="albums">Mean Girls Original Cast Recording by Various Artists</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Tony Nominee for Best New Musical</h3>
			<p>I'm not going to waste time rolling my eyes at people who think it's lame that there are so many musicals based off of movies these days... Musicals have always been based off of the popular media of the day. It happens to be movies now, and none are more fetch than the cult-hit Mean Girls. The music and book are by Tina Fey and her husband who composed the music for 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It's really a slam dunk, and "Sexy" is one of several songs that never fails to make me laugh.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JorjaSmith_Lost&Found.jpg" alt="The album cover to Lost & Found by Jorja Smith.">
			<h2 class="albums">Lost & Found by Jorja Smith</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best New Artist</h3>
			<p>She's one of a million young women with great voices and nice songwriting chops, but she's the standout from last year. I really hope she makes it. There's a tenderness to her that I like.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JamesBay_ElectricLight.jpg" alt="The album cover to Electric Light by James Bay.">
			<h2 class="albums">Electric Light by James Bay</h2>
			<p>"Let It Go" – not THAT "Let It Go" – was a massive hit for James Bay in 2014, and then he dropped off the face of the Earth. His latest seems to indicate that he spent the time in some sort of industry focus group, which is a real shame. His second album is all over the place, but it's still enjoyable. I just wish it were a little more authentic to the James Bay who appeared on his last album.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Drake_Scorpion.jpg" alt="The album cover to Scorpion by Drake.">
			<h2 class="albums">Scorpion by Drake</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Album of the Year</h3>
			<p>I have to admit something: I'm not really that big of a Drake fan. He's just a little... basic for me. That being said, I love me some "Hotline Bling," so who am I to judge? I tend to enjoy him best when he's a little goofy, and this double album is decidedly NOT that. However, I have to admit that "God's Plan" is brilliant and cements his placement in the rap pantheon.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/EricChurch_DesperateMan.jpg" alt="The album cover to Desperate Man by Eric Church.">
			<h2 class="albums">Desperate Man by Eric Church</h2>
			<p>My mom loves Eric Church, so it is difficult for me to admit that I liked this album too. "Some Of It" is real country music and not that garbage on country radio.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/AmandaShires_ToTheSunset.jpg" alt="The album cover to To The Sunset by Amanda Shires.">
			<h2 class="albums">To The Sunset by Amanda Shires</h2>
			<p>This is one of those albums that I never would have discovered if it weren't my obsession with keeping up with reviews on Pitchfork and Rolling Stone. It didn't quite warrant a ranking on the top 50 list, but I was really glad I listened to it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Deafheaven_OrdinaryCorruptHumanLove.jpg" alt="The album cover to Ordinary Corrupt Human Love by Deafheaven.">
			<h2 class="albums">Ordinary Corrupt Human Love by Deafheaven</h2>
			<p>I don't listen to a lot of metal music, but throw in a few melodic and operatic touches, and I'm there. "Night People" is gorgeous. True story.</p>
