      <h1>My Top 50 Albums of 2018</h1>
    <p>I finally did it. I listened to 150+ albums in 2018 – thank God for Spotify – and the list I made is below. Please use the links to navigate to different sections of the list. At the bottom, you'll find a playlist consisting of my favorite song from each album. Enjoy! </p>

		<h2 class="albums">Swimming by Mac Miller</h2>
		<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rap Album</h3>
		<p>It's an utter shame when someone young passes away. To be honest, I hadn't heard of Mac Miller before his passing. This album is largely hit or miss, but songs like "Self Care" seemed to indicate there were great things to come. R.I.P.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">Little Dark Age by MGMT</h2>
			<p>This was simply a pleasant listen. No reinventing the wheel here, but "Me and Michael" proves that not everything has to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Maluma_FAME.jpg" alt="The album cover to F.A.M.E. by Maluma.">
			<h2 class="albums">F.A.M.E. by Maluma</h2>
			<p>Maluma is my Latin pop star guilty pleasure. He's got a sultry voice and some great videos. This album wasn't quite the statement of his arrival in mainstream pop music that I hoped it would be, but it was welcome nonetheless. Check out "El Préstamo" and "Marinero."</p>

		<p id="copyright">Some disclaimers: 1. This is my personal list and subsequently reflects my personal tastes. Sorry if an album you love didn't make the cut or isn't as high as you'd like. 2. I don't own any of these images. They are being used to make me and my site look cool and to promote the material. If you like what I have to say about this music, buy the album. Please don't sue me.</p>
