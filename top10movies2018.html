		<p>I know there are a lot of opinions out there about this movie, but perhaps more so than at the end of any other film this year, I walked out of the theater moved. I texted my boyfriend to thank him for being part of my life and for ending what I think is a ubiquitous dread of unceasing lonelinees that all queer people face at one time or another. I knew almost nothing about Freddie Mercury going into this movie, and I left relating to him and with a reignited fervor in my steadfast dedication to LGBTQ rights and history. So I pretty much had the opposite reaction to every other queer person who watched this movie? I'd love to discuss it with someone because I simply don't see it as anything but joyous by film's end. I understand there were a lot of liberties taken with the depiction of Freddie's life and the band's history, but in my opinion, if anyone is going to understand the need for a little drama, it's Freddie freakin' Mercury. All that being said, as a film, it's pretty mediocre. It's a paint-by-numbers biopic that got as far as it did because of the subject matter. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the hell out of it though.</p>

		<h3 id="statement">AFI Movie of the Year</h3>
		<h3 id="statement">National Board of Review Award Winner for Best Actor (Viggo Mortenson) and Best Film</h3>
		<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Director - Motion Picture and Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy (Viggo Mortenson)</h3>
		<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Winner for Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture (Mahershala Ali) and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy</h3>

		<h3 id="statement">Academy Award Winner for Writing (Original Screenplay), Actor in a Supporting Role (Mahershala Ali) and Best Picture</h3>
		<p>Let me make one thing clear about this movie: It shouldn't have won Best Picture at the Oscars. In fact, the only win it truly deserved was Mahershala Ali's. The fact that this movie won admist such a display of diversity is a testament to the fact that Hollywood still very much has some problems when it comes to race issues. I do have some kind things to say about the movie however. It is a palatable look at how to improve race relations in America, and for some, I suppose it may spur some introspection. I doubt it will for very many though. The greatest achievement of this film is that more so than any other mainstream movie that comes to mind, it displays the weight of the history of slavery and racial profiling on Black people from a Black perspective as well as the significance of a Black shared culture in a way that I think white people can understand. It's brief, but it's there. That's huge. It's not a film for Black people as much as it wishes it were, and that is a pretty huge problem, especially considering the fact that Don Shirley's family has denounced the film. I maintain, however, that it is a powerful albeit apparently fictionalized reminder for white people that they really shouldn't need anymore.</p>

		<h2 class="albums">The Favourite</h2>
		<h3 id="statement">AFI Movie of the Year</h3>
		<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture (Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone) and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy</h3>

		<h3 id="statement">Academy Award Winner for Actress in a Leading Role (Olivia Colman)</h3>
		<p>I didn't get this movie. I feel like I understood the nature of its playful politics, but something about the campiness of it kept me from taking it very seriously. i.e. Less seriously than it even wanted me to take it. As a result, I didn't care about the characters or their goals. Any triumphs and losses in their manipulations that I witnessed felt hollow and like a writer showing off. One or perhaps two times I actually felt something while watching The Favourite were Olivia Colman moments, so I suppose that speaks to the magnitude of her talent. I can't get behind her beating Glenn Close for the Oscar, but that's the reality of what happened. There is a tremendous amount of talent on display in this movie from top to bottom, and it is a gorgous film to look at. I want to watch it again to see if I just had an off day when I went to see it, but I think this one might just not be for me.<p>

		<div class="albums"><img class="movies" src="img/My Top 10 Movies 2018/InfinityWar.jpg" alt="The movie poster to Avengers: Infinity War.">
			<h2 class="albums">Avengers: Infinity War</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Academy Award Nominee for Visual Effects</h3>
			<p>This movie was ten years in the making. There was no way it was going to please everyone, but man did they try. The screenplay is an impressive feat in an architectural sort of way, but it's not what I would call an amazing story. At the end of the day, I left satisfied knowing that a second part was to come. And that ending... one of the most talked about of the year for sure.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">Boy Erased</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Original Song - Motion Picture ("Revelation" by Troye Sivan) and Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama (Lucas Hedges)</h3>
			<p>I didn't care for how this movie was directed. It was a little too on the nose at times when a subtler hand could have done wonders, but the film documents an important issue that deserves any attention it can get. Lucas Hedges also gives a master class in acting here and at a remarkably young age. He is never not displaying the conflict between his desire to uphold his family's values and his desire to be free of them, and it's impressive. I recommend watching this movie for him alone.</p>

			<p>Man, this series is so much better than it has any right to be. The screenplay is a hair too complex for its own good, but it mostly keeps from crumbling under its own weight. The action is as tightly choreographed as anything you'll see, and the talent assembled keeps things fresh and fun. I'd watch a million of these if they can keep this caliber of action movie up.</p>

		<div class="albums"><img class="movies" src="img/My Top 10 Movies 2018/Incredibles2.jpg" alt="The movie poster to Incredibles 2.">
			<h2 class="albums">Incredibles 2</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">National Board of Review Award Winner for Best Animated Feature</h3>
			<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Motion Picture - Animated</h3>
			<h3 id="statement">Academy Award Nominee for Animated Feature Film</h3>
			<p>The original Incredibles film is one of my all-time favorite animated movies, and this long-awaited sequel does a lot to rekindle that magic. It's funny, charming and well animated (Disney-Pixar. Duh.) If it weren't for another animated film that I'll get to later, this one would have really done it for me this year.</p>

		<div class="albums"><img class="movies" src="img/My Top 10 Movies 2018/EighthGrade.jpg" alt="The movie poster to Eighth Grade.">
			<h2 class="albums">Eighth Grade</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">AFI Movie of the Year</h3>
			<h3 id="statement">National Board of Review Award Winner for Best Directorial Debut (Bo Burnhum) and Top Films</h3>
			<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy (Elsie Fisher)</h3>
			<p>Eighth Grade came out of nowhere and sucker punched me right in the heart. I've never been a 13-year-old girl, but I strongly identified with this piece. It's all about growing up and a relationship with a single parent who is doing their best. There are specific struggles to the time that it's set, but there are also struggles that are timeless. It's a remarkable film in its honesty and simplicity, and I cannot wait to see more from Bo Burnhum and Elsie Fisher.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">At Eternity's Gate</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama (Willem Dafoe)</h3>
			<h3 id="statement">Academy Award Nominee for Actor in a Leading Role (Willem Dafoe)</h3>
			<p>I can't get enough of Vincent Van Gogh. He's always been one of my favorite artists, although I'm a little embarrassed before that it's not someone more esoteric. Whatever. He's cool. I cry every time I watch the episode of Doctor Who about him, and I was half-wanting Loving Vincent to take down Coco for Best Animated Film last year. This movie is very experimental at times, and it gets some interesting performances as a result. Willem Dafoe continues to impress me lately. He's showing a range that I did not know he had. And Oscar Issac is a welcome addition to any cast. Anyone who has ever felt the urge to create should go see At Eternity’s Gate.</p>

		<div class="albums"><img class="movies" src="img/My Top 10 Movies 2018/Stan&Ollie.jpg" alt="The movie poster to Stan & Ollie.">
			<h2 class="albums">Stan & Ollie</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy (John C. Reilly)</h3>
			<p>I didn't expect to love this movie as much I did. I knew next to nothing about Laurel and Hardy's careers, much less the men themselves. This film is a sweet and endearing chronicle of their golden years, and I ended the theater with a smile on my face, a tear in my eye and a desire to learn more about their films. John C. Reilly gives a typically stellar performance that no one will notice, but dammit, he's so good. Seriously. Check this movie out.</p>

		<div class="albums"><img class="movies" src="img/My Top 10 Movies 2018/Destroyer.jpg" alt="The movie poster to Destroyer.">
		<h2 class="albums">Destroyer</h2>
		<h3 id="statement">Golden Globe Nominee for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama or Comedy (Nicole Kidman)</h3>
		<p>I was not ready for this movie. I may not have seen The Hours – I'll get to it, OK? – but this is by far the best thing I've ever seen Nicole Kidman do. She is unrecognizeable, and I'm not just talking about the superficial. The way she moves and speaks is emotionless and dessicated. It's truly remarkable. It doesn't hurt that it's a clever little script made all the more engaging by the criminally underrated Sebastian Stan and the amazing Tatiana Maslany. This is a bleak, bleak film, so I don't see it being everyone's cup of tea, but man, it is one impressive feat.</p>
