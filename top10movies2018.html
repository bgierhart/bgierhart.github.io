      <h1>My Top 10 Movies of 2018</h1>
    <p>I finally did it. I watched quite a few movies last year, and the list I made is below. Please use the links to navigate to different sections of the list. Enjoy!</p>

	<div class="albums"><img class="swimming" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MacMiller_Swimming.jpg" alt="The album cover to Swimming by Mac Miller.">
		<h2 class="albums">Swimming by Mac Miller</h2>
		<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rap Album</h3>
		<p>It's an utter shame when someone young passes away. To be honest, I hadn't heard of Mac Miller before his passing. This album is largely hit or miss, but songs like "Self Care" seemed to indicate there were great things to come. R.I.P.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MGMT_LittleDarkAge.jpg" alt="The album cover to Little Dark Age by MGMT.">
			<h2 class="albums">Little Dark Age by MGMT</h2>
			<p>This was simply a pleasant listen. No reinventing the wheel here, but "Me and Michael" proves that not everything has to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Maluma_FAME.jpg" alt="The album cover to F.A.M.E. by Maluma.">
			<h2 class="albums">F.A.M.E. by Maluma</h2>
			<p>Maluma is my Latin pop star guilty pleasure. He's got a sultry voice and some great videos. This album wasn't quite the statement of his arrival in mainstream pop music that I hoped it would be, but it was welcome nonetheless. Check out "El Pr√©stamo" and "Marinero."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Metric_ArtofDoubt.jpg" alt="The album cover to Art of Doubt by Metric.">
			<h2 class="albums">Art of Doubt by Metric</h2>
			<p>Raise your hand if you discovered Metric from Academy Award Winner Brie Larson's *cough* superior cover of one of their songs in Scott Pilgrim? Well, I did anyway. I'm glad I became a fan because their catalogue is a lot of fun. "Now or Never Now" is a huge song and isn't afraid to admit it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Chvrches_LoveIsDead.jpg" alt="The album cover to Love Is Dead by Chvrches.">
			<h2 class="albums">Love Is Dead by Chvrches</h2>
			<p>Out of the 70 albums on this list, this was perhaps my biggest disappointment. Chvrches is fun and brash, unapologetic in its youthful electronic dance energy, and this one seemed to take itself a little too seriously. Check out "Miracle" though. It's classic Chvrches, albeit a little more poppy.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ShawnMendes_ShawnMendes.jpg" alt="The album cover to Shawn Mendes by Shawn Mendes.">
			<h2 class="albums">Shawn Mendes by Shawn Mendes</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Pop Vocal Album</h3>
			<p>If his previous work has solidified his placement as a teenage heartthrob, this album is the beginning of his transition into something a little more serious. He's still got a ways to go, but there's a real artist somewhere in the person who helped create "Lost In Japan."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ArcticMonkey_Tranquility.jpg" alt="The album cover to Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino by Arctic Monkeys.">
			<h2 class="albums">Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino by Arctic Monkeys</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Alternative Music Album</h3>
			<p>I love me some Arctic Monkeys, but this one was kind of a bummer. Look, it's a concept album about a hotel on the moon. No one wanted to like it more than I did. Unfortunately, this album ended up being little more than a David Bowie impression. I mean, a decent one, but an impression nonetheless. "Four Out Of Five" is where that tactic seemed to work for them best.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/BebeRexha_Expectations.jpg" alt="The album cover to Expectations by Bebe Rexha.">
			<h2 class="albums">Expectations by Bebe Rexha</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best New Artist</h3>
			<p>Bebe Rexha seemed to come out of nowhere for me. I'm not completely sold that she's more than a flash in the pan, but man, "I'm A Mess" is catchy and true as hell.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/KylieMinogue_Golden.jpg" alt="The album cover to Golden by Kylie Minogue.">
			<h2 class="albums">Golden by Kylie Minogue</h2>
			<p>This is your first of probably several reminders that this blog is written by a gay man. This album is a hot mess, and I love it anyway. I mean, why is an Australian making a country music album with a song that prominently features a Cuban reggaeton band? Why not? Step it up, Keith Urban.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/RitaOra_Phoenix.jpg" alt="The album cover to Phoenix by Rita Ora.">
			<h2 class="albums">Phoenix by Rita Ora</h2>
			<p>When will Rita Ora get the mainstream American audience that she deserves? Who knows, but here's another album full of bangers for you to ignore. One of my friends called her "Value Brand Rihanna," and... I admit that's hilarious. It also hurt though.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Florence_HighAsHope.jpg" alt="The album cover to High As Hope by Florence + the Machine.">
			<h2 class="albums">High As Hope by Florence + the Machine</h2>
			<p>I guess I'll just have to accept that I'll forever be chasing the high of Florence's first two albums for the rest of my life. Nothing here really comes close except for "Hunger," which shows that Welch's penchant for the dramatic and killer voice are very much intact.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/FallOutBoy_Mania.jpg" alt="The album cover to MANIA by Fall Out Boy.">
			<h2 class="albums">MANIA by Fall Out Boy</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rock Album</h3>
			<p>Perhaps my guiltiest of guiltiest pleasures, I happen to think the world is better for having Fall Out Boy in it. Their album "God Save Rock and Roll" is legitimately good by any standard, and while "MANIA" doesn't quite reach the same cheekiness, it has its moments.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Panic_PrayForTheWicked.jpg" alt="The album cover to Pray For The Wicked by Panic! at the Disco.">
			<h2 class="albums">Pray For The Wicked by Panic! At The Disco</h2>
			<p>I'm going to admit that the sole reason this album is here is for the stellar song "High Hopes." I loved Panic! at the Disco as much as anyone else in high school and listented to their albums with dedication. "High Hopes" so perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to want to make something of yourself that it never fails to pump me up. Also, it's full of little musical easter eggs from the different sounds the band has attempted over the years. It's fun, well constructed, and if you don't like it, I don't like you.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MeanGirlsOCR.jpg" alt="The cover to the Mean Girls Original Cast Recording.">
			<h2 class="albums">Mean Girls Original Cast Recording by Various Artists</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Tony Nominee for Best New Musical</h3>
			<p>I'm not going to waste time rolling my eyes at people who think it's lame that there are so many musicals based off of movies these days... Musicals have always been based off of the popular media of the day. It happens to be movies now, and none are more fetch than the cult-hit Mean Girls. The music and book are by Tina Fey and her husband who composed the music for 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It's really a slam dunk, and "Sexy" is one of several songs that never fails to make me laugh.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JorjaSmith_Lost&Found.jpg" alt="The album cover to Lost & Found by Jorja Smith.">
			<h2 class="albums">Lost & Found by Jorja Smith</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best New Artist</h3>
			<p>She's one of a million young women with great voices and nice songwriting chops, but she's the standout from last year. I really hope she makes it. There's a tenderness to her that I like.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JamesBay_ElectricLight.jpg" alt="The album cover to Electric Light by James Bay.">
			<h2 class="albums">Electric Light by James Bay</h2>
			<p>"Let It Go" ‚Äì not THAT "Let It Go" ‚Äì was a massive hit for James Bay in 2014, and then he dropped off the face of the Earth. His latest seems to indicate that he spent the time in some sort of industry focus group, which is a real shame. His second album is all over the place, but it's still enjoyable. I just wish it were a little more authentic to the James Bay who appeared on his last album.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Drake_Scorpion.jpg" alt="The album cover to Scorpion by Drake.">
			<h2 class="albums">Scorpion by Drake</h2>
			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Album of the Year</h3>
			<p>I have to admit something: I'm not really that big of a Drake fan. He's just a little... basic for me. That being said, I love me some "Hotline Bling," so who am I to judge? I tend to enjoy him best when he's a little goofy, and this double album is decidedly NOT that. However, I have to admit that "God's Plan" is brilliant and cements his placement in the rap pantheon.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/EricChurch_DesperateMan.jpg" alt="The album cover to Desperate Man by Eric Church.">
			<h2 class="albums">Desperate Man by Eric Church</h2>
			<p>My mom loves Eric Church, so it is difficult for me to admit that I liked this album too. "Some Of It" is real country music and not that garbage on country radio.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/AmandaShires_ToTheSunset.jpg" alt="The album cover to To The Sunset by Amanda Shires.">
			<h2 class="albums">To The Sunset by Amanda Shires</h2>
			<p>This is one of those albums that I never would have discovered if it weren't my obsession with keeping up with reviews on Pitchfork and Rolling Stone. It didn't quite warrant a ranking on the top 50 list, but I was really glad I listened to it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Deafheaven_OrdinaryCorruptHumanLove.jpg" alt="The album cover to Ordinary Corrupt Human Love by Deafheaven.">
			<h2 class="albums">Ordinary Corrupt Human Love by Deafheaven</h2>
			<p>I don't listen to a lot of metal music, but throw in a few melodic and operatic touches, and I'm there. "Night People" is gorgeous. True story.</p>

			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/LilWayne_TheCarterV.jpg" alt="The album cover to Tha Carter V by Lil Wayne.">
				<h2 class="albums">50. Tha Carter V by Lil Wayne</h2>
				<p>I get that it's not cool to like Lil Wayne, and this album is definitely a fall from the days of Tha Carter III. But... I still liked it. A lot. Fight me.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/CourtneyBarnett_TellMe.jpg" alt="The album cover to Tell Me How You Really Feel by Courtney Barnett.">
				<h2 class="albums">49. Tell Me How You Really Feel by Courtney Barnett</h2>
				<p>There's something raw about Courtney Barnett's songwriting for me. Not in a good way, like each song is a first draft and not quite a finished product. That aspect does have its charms, however, and there are times where I welcome the unpolished quality of her music. "Need A Little Time" is the epitome of that spirit on this record.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/COASTCITY.jpg" alt="The album cover to COASTCITY by COASTCITY.">
				<h2 class="albums">48. COASTCITY by COASTCITY</h2>
				<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album</h3>
				<p>These two Puetro Rican musicians are pretty much nobodies who sprang to stardom simply by making some great music. It's the kind of story you don't hear too much of anymore, and I'm really happy for them. Their Grammy nomination is well deserved. That bridge in "Noches y Ma√±anas." Everything. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Borns_BlueMadonna.jpg" alt="The album cover to Blue Madonna by B√∏rns">
				<h2 class="albums">47. Blue Madonna by B√∏rns</h2>
				<p>2015's "Dopamine" was one of my favorite albums of that year. B√∏rns is just a weirdo, and I appreciate that. Anyone who can utilize a theremin solo like he does in "Supernatural" is a god to me.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Dawes_Passwords.jpeg" alt="The album cover to Passwords by Dawes">
				<h2 class="albums">46. Passwords by Dawes</h2>
				<p>This isn't quite the follow-up to "We're All Gonna Die" that I hoped it would be. It seems they tried to speak perhaps a little too hard to the times we're in socio-politically speaking. That being said, "Living in the Future" works and is probably the album's best song when it comes to achieving those ambitions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/AshleyMcBride_GirlGoingNowhere.jpg" alt="The album cover to Girl Going Nowhere by Ashley McBride">
				<h2 class="albums">45. Girl Going Nowhere by Ashley McBride</h2>
				<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Country Album</h3>
				<p>This album epitomizes that moment when a completely unassuming person goes up to karaoke and blows you away. I had no idea I would hear one of the best country music albums of the year from a complete nobody. A mention on Obama's annual list of favorite songs of the year doesn't hurt either. Good for her.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/Christine_Chris.jpg" alt="The album cover to Chris by Christine and the Queens">
				<h2 class="albums">44. Chris by Christine and the Queens</h2>
				<p>I didn't know much about Christine and the Queens before my annual music listen-through, but I'm glad I'm brought up to speed now. I can see the influence they've had on some of my favorite groups, most notably HAIM. To me anyway. Anyway, give the French side of the double album a listen if that's your thing.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JakeShears.jpg" alt="The album cover to Jake Shears by Jake Shears">
				<h2 class="albums">43. Jake Shears by Jake Shears</h2>
				<p>Scissors Sisters fans rejoice! Jake Shears finally released a solo album, and he recorded a decent chunk of it in my hometown. I even got to hear some of this material for the first time at a special impromptu concert he threw together as a thank you to Louisville for hosting him. His energy is infections, and the album does little to lose that.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ClaudiaBrant_Sincera.jpg" alt="The album cover to Sincera by Claudia Brant">
				<h2 class="albums">42. Sincera by Claudia Brant</h2>
				<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Latin Pop Album</h3>
				<p>Argentinian Claudia Brant is the queen of Latin jazz, and this album is a great case as for why. Her voice is pristine, and her compositions are languid. They're truly a showcase what she can do with her voice. I'm a fan for life.</p>
			</div>
					<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/BloodOrange_NegroSwan.jpg" alt="The album cover to Negro Swan by Blood Orange">
						<h2 class="albums">41. Negro Swan by Blood Orange</h2>
						<p>Blood Orange sure knows how to produce a song to mask the pain. "Charcoal Baby" is case and point and serves as the creative zenith to "Negro Swan."</p>

			<h2 class="albums">40. Vibras by J Balvin</h2>
			<p>J Balvin had quite the year. He finally broke through into the mainstream and even has a Grammy nomination as a producer for one of Cardi B's songs. I can't wait to see where the future takes him.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/MariahCarey_Caution.jpg" alt="The album cover to Caution by Mariah Carey">
				<h2 class="albums">39. Caution by Mariah Carey</h2>
				<p>Mimi's career has had more ups and downs than a... well, Mariah Carey song, but it's nice to see her on the upswing again. "Giving Me Life" wins the award for the most appropriately titled song of the year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/ChristinaAguilera_Liberation.jpg" alt="The album cover to Liberation by Christina Aguilera">
				<h2 class="albums">38. Liberation by Christina Aguilera</h2>
				<p>Christina Aguilera's highly anticipated album seemed all but doomed to fail after fans around the world uttered a collective "Girl..." upon hearing "Accelerate" for the first time. Turns out those fears were for not, and Xtina did not disappoint. Hell, I even kind of like "Accelerate" now. The chorus anyway.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/the1975.png" alt="The album cover to A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships by The 1975">
				<h2 class="albums">37. A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships by The 1975</h2>
				<p>When I first heard of this band in 2016, I really didn't think I'd like them. They seemed to me full of pretense and hollow musicianship. Thankfully, that seems to be all part of their schtick. They surprise me each time I listen to them, and I hear something new in their deceptively simple music.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/TroyeSivan_Bloom.png" alt="The album cover to Bloom by Troye Sivan">
				<h2 class="albums">36. Bloom by Troye Sivan</h2>
				<p>Nothing prepared me for when I saw the video to "Bloom" for the first time. It is unabashed and proud queerness at its finest and queerest, and I was 100 percent there for it. There's room for growth, but "Bloom" is a bold statement from an artist I cannot wait to hear more from. The future looks bright.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/JPEGMAFIA_Veteran.png" alt="The album cover to Veteran by JPEGMAFIA">
			<h2 class="albums">35. Veteran by JPEGMAFIA</h2>
			<p>There's something aggressive about JPEGMAFIA's music. It's arresting and interesting to listen to. I was completely blown away by this album, and it takes a lot for me to be impressed by rap music these days.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/KaliUchis_Isolation.jpg" alt="The album cover to Isolation by Kali Uchis">
			<h2 class="albums">34. Isolation by Kali Uchis</h2>
			<p>This Colombian-American singer-songwriter sure knows how to make beat that grabs my attention. As soon as I heard "Dead To Me" for the first time, I knew I was hooked.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/TheBeths_FutureMeHatesMe.jpg" alt="The album cover to Future Me Hates Me by The Beths">
			<h2 class="albums">33. Future Me Hates Me by The Beths</h2>
			<p>The Beths remind me of a modernized version of The Shangri-Las. They're singing to that same basic heartache one feels in their teenage years when everything is so dramatic and the threat of unending loneliness seems utterly imminent. How ironic that that sentiment should make this album such a joy to listen to.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/SnailMail_Lush.jpg" alt="The album cover to Lush by Snail Mail">
			<h2 class="albums">32. Lush by Snail Mail</h2>
			<p>The person behind the vocals and songwriting on display here is so prodigiously and rawly talented that it's almost too much to take in sometimes. i.e. Is this another amazing song? Or is this just average... for her. It's hard to tell sometimes. I look forward to listening to more Snail Mail and attempting to find out.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="albums"><img class="albums" src="img/My Top 50 Albums 2018/PistolAnnies_InterstateGospel.jpg" alt="The album cover to Interstate Gospel by Pistol Annies">
			<h2 class="albums">31. Interstate Gospel by Pistol Annies</h2>
			<p>Pistol Annies until now has been little more than The Miranda Lambert Band to me. There's certainly still plenty of Lambert's star power on display here, but for the first time, it appears as though they are their own independent and cohesive unit. Songs like "Milkman" really reflect on what contemporary Southern life is like now: a culture that is hellbent on judging others simply to hide the fact that they are so close to commiting sins of their own. </p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Pop Vocal Album</h3>
			<p>Ariana Grande is a boss. If you disagree, you're just wrong. Plain and simple. Not only is her voice ridiculous, but she has the emotional fortitude to withstand some of the worst tragedies that can happen to a person, all while seemingly remaining as sweet as can be and producing mega-hit after mega-hit just to make us happy. We don't deserve her.</p>

			<p>CARE FOR ME is visceral and emotional. It's everything that good art should be. It's tough to pick one song becuase the album is such a mosaic, but if I had to choose one, I pick "LIFE." Give the whole album a try.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Dance/Electronic Album</h3>
			<p>I always struggle with instrumental albums. My musical background is so heavily entrenched in vocal music that it's difficult for me to find my footing in that foreign landscape. "Singularity" hooked me though. It is absolutely enrapturing and absolutely worth your time.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">26. Freedom by Amen Dunes</h2>
			<p>Amen Dunes is the quintessential Pitchfork rocker to me. Esoteric and moody. Talented and conceited but also paradoxically affable. A little pretentious but also completely indifferent to others' responses to his music. If any of that makes sense and appeals to you, you'll want to give "Freedom" a try. </p>

			<p>Epic does not even begin to describe this album. The production on this album is slick, and the narrative behind it is moving. This is easily the best thing I've ever heard from Travis Scott. </p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best R&B Album</h3>
			<p>This album breaks a lot of rules for me. I normally don't get into live albums. I have to be a super fan for that. And when I do, I always listen to studio material first. In the case of PJ Morton, I knew nothing about him until I was doing my Grammy prep and listened to this live album verison of 2017's "Gumbo." To put it simply: I was impressed. If you sound this good live, you're the shit. End of story.</p>

			<p>I'll never forget when Esperanza Spalding won Best New Artist at the Grammys and beat out Drake, Florence + the Machine and Justin Bieber ‚Äì wasn't sad about that last one. Who was this girl? One of the most amazing musicians of the century and a verifiable genius. That's who. This album isn't one of her best, but even her mediocre material warrants a placement this high on my list.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">18. El Mal Querer by Rosal√≠a</h2>
			<p>Spanish singer-songwriter Rosal√≠a is a musical powerhouse. She has brought flamenco back to modern audiences with the help of previous collaborators J Balvin and Pharrell Williams. On this album, the Moorish influence on Spanish music is obvious especially when she contextualizes Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me A River" with her sound in  "BAGDAD - Cap 7: Liturgia." In an indirect way, this is Justin Timberlake's best contribution to music in 2018. We won't talk about "Man of the Woods."</p>

			<p>This is another band whose material I hadn't really jumped into until now. What a languid and immersive songwriter Trent Reznor is. This album pales in comparison to some of their other stuff, but man is it still engaging to a new listener.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">15. Now Only by Mount Eerie</h2>
			<p>On 2017's "A Crow Looked At Me," frontman Phil Elverum had just lost his wife, and the subsequent album is raw and powerful as one would expect after such a loss. It's here though in "Now Only," a sort of companion album, that that grief is fully explored with some time and distance. "Earth" is heartbreaking, but it also offers hope of healing.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Urban Contemporary Album</h3>
			<p>If Beyonc√©'s "Lemonade" and Jay-Z's "4:44" are the first installments, their reunion and reconciliation in "EVERYTHING IS LOVE" is the end of the trilogy. It's not quite the musical slam dunk that I expected it to be, but it's still a hell of an achievement. In addition, to being one of my favorite phrases, album highlight "APESHIT" showcases exactly what they they think of themselves: worthy of inclusion in The Louvre. If you watch the video, you can see that they're actually there. Anyone who has enough clout to make that happen has ARRIVED.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Latin Pop Album</h3>
			<p>Natalia Lafourcade began this epic dive into the folklore and mythology of Latin America last year with Vol. 1. I don't love the result as much as her own original material, but her covers and reinterpertations of Latinx songs are so beautiful that it's hard to be too disappointed. Maybe it's her ascent into a slighly more mainstream position thanks to her inclusion in the studio version of Disney's Coco's "Remember Me," but her version of her native Mexico's "La Llorona" is a tribute worthy of the gods.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Album of the Year</h3>
			<p>I can't talk about this album without mentioning how awesome so many of the songs are. "Django Jane," "Pynk," and "Make Me Feel" are almost certainly the songs that will be remembered from this album and deservedly so. I want to highlight the power behind my favorite track, "So Afraid" though. Where she goes big on those other songs, she goes small here, and it works to give the album some dynamics. Love.</p>

			<p>Kendrick Lamar found a way to be nominated for a Grammy after he was robbed after last year's "DAMN." lost to *sigh* Bruno Mars. He won't win again, but I don't really care anymore. I doubt he does either. When I heard that he was producing and performing most of the tracks on this album, I was sold. Like the movie, this album is a testament to Black excellence, and it is an absolutely essential mention when discussing the pop culture of 2018. I cannot wait to see SZA and Kendrick perform at the Oscars.</p>

			<p>This one completely blindsided me. I was listening to it one day after going through one of my music lists, and "The Shell" made me cry in public. "Night Shift" is also worth mentioning and is an extremely close second favorite. Here's another artist I cannot wait to hear more from.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best New Artist</h3>
			<p>The kids are more than all right. Jesus. These kids are apparently finds of Beyonc√©, and in my opinion, they outperformed her this year. Their voices are ridiculous, their songwriting demands that you bask in their excellence. I love the title track the best because it encapsulates everything that's so great about them.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Rap Album and Album of the Year</h3>
			<p>You can't talk about 2018 without talking about Cardi B. She was simply unstoppable. The same fierceness behind "Bodak Yellow," is on display throughout the rest of the album, but I'd like to highlight "Be Careful." It shows a vulnerability that's so different from the rest of her material. This girl has range, and she will go the distance.</p>

			<p>There was perhaps no album more hotly anticipated this year than this one, and it did not disappoint. "Honey," "Missing U," "Because It's in the Music," "Never Again," I could go on and on... I decided to go with "Human Being" though. I just can't get it out of my head. That's a common problem with Robyn, but her songs are so good that I never tire of them.</p>

			<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album</h3>
			<p>This album is cool. Plain and simple. My dad listented to nothing but salsa and other classical tropical Latin music, so it never even occurred to me until high school that Latinx people have alternative music too. In a word, this album is nothing short of impressive.</p>

			<h2 class="albums">2. Be The Cowboy by Mitski</h2>
			<p>I love Mitski. She's so intelligent, both emotionally and otherwise, and her music is perfect in its imperfection. I saw her open for Lorde last year in an arena, and it may has well have been a much smaller venue. She doesn't sacrifice intimacy. In fact, her songs demand it. "Geyser" and "Nobody" are all fantastic songs, but I can't stop thinking about "Why Didn't You Stop Me?"

				<h3 id="statement">Grammy Nominee for Best Country Album and Album of the Year</h3>
				<p>Anyone who knows me is probably tired of me and how much I've talked about Kacey Musgraves and this album over the past year. I don't care. Every single song is amazing. Musgraves writes like it's the first time anyone has written about these topics. They're deceptively simple but so affecting. "Butterflies," "Wonder Woman," even the undeniably fun "High Horse." However, I decided to go with "Love Is A Wild Thing" because it is everything I love about Kacey in one song: simple, pure and true.</p>
